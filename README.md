Project pico-24bargraph
=======================

This is a subset and simplified version of Adafruit's
"LED Backpack library for Arduino" adapted for the
Raspberry Pi Pico.

See file `pico-24bargraph.cpp` for an example.

Note that this version of the driver-class is not compatible to the original
class.
